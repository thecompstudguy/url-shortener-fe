Last updated: 2025-12-28

These Terms of Use apply to this URL Shortener site and its related API service (the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these terms.

If you have questions, email `the.compstud.guy@universitea.shop`.

## Use at your own risk

The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

## Acceptable use

You agree not to use the Service to create or share links that:
- are illegal, malicious, or deceptive (malware, phishing, scams, fraud),
- violate someone else’s rights (copyright, trademarks, privacy),
- are used to harass, threaten, or harm others,
- attempt to bypass security, rate limits, or abuse protections.

## Link safety

Shortened links can point to third-party websites. We do not control those destinations and are not responsible for their content, availability, or policies. Use caution before clicking links, even short ones.

## Moderation and removal

We may remove, disable, or refuse to generate short links at any time, for any reason (including abuse prevention, legal compliance, or operational safety).

## Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, or profits arising from your use of the Service.

## Changes

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
